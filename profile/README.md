# 🌐 ZARISH SPHERE PLATFORM

> **An open, sovereign, interoperable digital public infrastructure platform for health systems.**

Zarish Sphere is a **platform-of-platforms** designed to help countries **design, govern, deploy, and evolve** national health information systems **without vendor lock-in**.

It does **not replace** existing systems such as OpenMRS or DHIS2.
It **coordinates, governs, and future-proofs** them.

---

## 🧭 Why Zarish Sphere Exists

Across low- and middle-income countries, health systems face the same challenges:

* Fragmented software ecosystems
* Vendor-dependent deployments
* Weak interoperability
* Project-driven, not lifecycle-driven systems
* Loss of national ownership over time

**Zarish Sphere addresses these challenges by focusing on governance, lifecycle control, and interoperability — not by building yet another monolithic HIS.**

---

## 🧱 What Zarish Sphere Is (and Is Not)

### ✔ What It *Is*

* A **governance & lifecycle framework** for digital health
* A **FHIR-first interoperability platform**
* A **documentation-as-code Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**
* A **reference architecture** for SaaS, PaaS, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
* A **country-owned, vendor-neutral approach**

### ✖ What It *Is Not*

* ❌ A monolithic HIS product
* ❌ A replacement for OpenMRS, DHIS2, or national systems
* ❌ A proprietary SaaS or vendor solution

---

## 🏗️ Platform Architecture (Conceptual)

Zarish Sphere operates across **five coordinated layers**:

1. **Governance & SSOT**

   * Documentation-as-Code
   * Architecture decisions
   * Country adoption maturity models (CAMM)

2. **Presentation Layer (SaaS)**

   * Web & mobile interfaces
   * Micro-frontends
   * Static, serverless delivery

3. **API & Interoperability Layer (PaaS)**

   * FHIR R5 services
   * OpenAPI contracts
   * Event-driven integration

4. **Data & Analytics Layer**

   * Clinical (transactional)
   * Public health (aggregate)
   * Analytics & BI

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

   * Country-owned deployments
   * One-click environment provisioning
   * Cloud / on-prem / hybrid

## 🔁 How Zarish Sphere Works With Existing Systems

| System            | Role in Zarish Sphere                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **OpenMRS**       | Clinical transaction engine             |
| **DHIS2**         | Population health & analytics           |
| **Custom HIS**    | Sovereign national implementations      |
| **Zarish Sphere** | Lifecycle governance & interoperability |

> Zarish Sphere enables **coexistence**, not replacement.

## 🌍 Country Adoption Maturity Model (CAMM)

Zarish Sphere introduces a **Country Adoption Maturity Model (CAMM)** to help countries evolve **step-by-step**, at their own pace.

| Level   | Description                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Level 0 | Fragmented systems                |
| Level 1 | Awareness & alignment             |
| Level 2 | Governed interoperability         |
| Level 3 | Platform enablement               |
| Level 4 | Sovereign digital health platform |
| Level 5 | Ecosystem leader                  |

Each country can:

* Self-assess
* Define a roadmap
* Track progress transparently

---

## 🧩 Modular, Not Monolithic

Zarish Sphere supports **modular adoption**:

* Start with **documentation & governance**
* Add **FHIR contracts**
* Introduce **reference implementations**
* Enable **IaC deployments**
* Grow into a **national platform**

There is **no “big bang” migration**.

---

## 🔓 Core Principles

* **FHIR-first** interoperability
* **Vendor neutrality**
* **Country data sovereignty**
* **Open standards & open governance**
* **Documentation before implementation**
* **Replaceable components**
* **Ethical & responsible use of AI**

---

## 📘 Documentation as the Single Source of Truth

Zarish Sphere treats documentation as **infrastructure**.

All decisions, architectures, and standards live in:

```
zs-docs/
```

This repository is the **authoritative source** for:

* Platform lifecycle
* Governance decisions
* Country roadmaps
* Reference architectures
* Standards & profiles

If it is not documented here — **it does not exist**.

## 🧠 Who Is This Platform For?

* Ministries of Health
* Directorates of Health Services
* National digital health units
* Donors & global health partners
* Implementers & NGOs
* Open-source communities
* Health professionals (non-coders included)

---

## 🧑‍💻 No-Code & Low-Code Friendly

Zarish Sphere is intentionally designed so that:

* Non-coders contribute via **GitHub Issues & Forms**
* Governance happens via **review & approval**, not code
* Automation handles repetitive tasks
* AI agents assist (but do not replace human decision-making)

---
